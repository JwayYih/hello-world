Hi, I'm Johnway!

I'm an engineer, but despite 4 years of undergraduate university and another year of graduate school, I'm still relatively new to coding.  I'm here to start a journey into coding and to see what I can create.  Hopefully I'll be able to learn from others along this path and also share the things I come across too.
