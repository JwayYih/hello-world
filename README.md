Hi, I'm Johnway!

I want to build products that change people’s lives. Currently, I’m pursuing an MBA with Johnson Cornell Tech, graduating Spring 2020.  I am actively seeking Product Management opportunities within the health technology industry.

Previously, as a product development engineer at Abbott Vascular, I worked on the development, validation, and launch of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease.  

In my work, I enjoy taking a holistic approach and strive to bridge the gaps between business, product design, and users. To do this, I ask…

“Who does this help? What does this solve? How can I make it better?”
